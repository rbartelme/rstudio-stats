# Lesson 2: Correlations vs. Probability

### Goal: Understand the difference between correlation and probability
        - Plot and correlation: deterministic vs. bayesian statistics
        - Essentials from probability theory
        - Bayesian thinking, or applied probability

## Examining Correlations

There are a number of statistical tests for normal distributions in the base R language. Additionally, this distribution  forms the basis of most introductory statistical courses and training. If you're familiar with line fitting in MS Excel, then you may have some familiarity with correlations and correlation coeffients R<sup>2</sup>

# Lesson 4: Bayesian Networks

### Goal: Build a simple Bayesian Network

#### The coronary data set contains the following 6 variables:

	- Smoking (smoking): a two-level factor with levels no and yes.

	- M. Work (strenuous mental work): a two-level factor with levels no and yes.

	- P. Work (strenuous physical work): a two-level factor with levels no and yes.

	- Pressure (systolic blood pressure): a two-level factor with levels <140 and >140.

	- Proteins (ratio of beta and alpha lipoproteins): a two-level factor with levels <3 and >3.

	- Family (family anamnesis of coronary heart disease): a two-level factor with levels neg and pos.

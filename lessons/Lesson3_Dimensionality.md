# Lesson 3: Dimensionality

### Lesson Goal: Understand when/how to reduce dimensions in data

- How to deal with multidimensional data
- What works best with missing data?
- How to decide how many dimensions are important

## Data clustering



## What is dimensionality?

We are most familiar with the Euclidean mathematical space (think X-Y, or X-Y-Z plots). However, we often have datasets that consist of multiple variables, and we would like to understand how they are interrelated. This could be analogous to a system of equations, where, we are looking to see which equations intersect with each other in a larger, or hyperdimensional, space. The concepts of dimensionality and dimension reduction are fundamental to understanding what lies behind machine learning and AI algorithms, from the most basic decision tree to the most complex neural network.

## Ordination or Gradient analysis



### Correspondence Analysis (CA)

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA)

### Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)

### Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS)
